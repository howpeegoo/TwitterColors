REQUIRES Adafruit_NeoPixel library for Arduino
REQUIRES serialport Ruby gem
REQUIRES json Ruby gem
REQUIRES color Ruby gem
REQUIRES redis Ruby gem
REQUIRES twitter Ruby gem

USES 1x8 board from RGB-123
USES RaspberryPi
USES Alamode from Wyolum
USES Ruby 1.9.3

The purpose of this project is to light LEDs based on input from Twitter.

To start your blinking:
    1. Follow the Getting Started instructions for your Alamode
    2. Upload the ArduinoColorSetter.ino to your Alamode, changing Pin Number
     and NUM_LEDS as appropriate.  I'm using D7 (pin 7) on my Alamode.
    3. Install Ruby 1.9.3 on your RaspberryPi and the gems above REQUIRES
    4. Get your Twitter Developer tokens from
     https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/tokens-devtwittercom
    5. You'll need to create a JSON file called "twitter_config.json" in
     your lib folder with the following text, filling in the double
     quotes with your keys generated via the twitter link above:
            {
                "consumer_key":"",
                "consumer_secret":"",
                "access_token":"",
                "access_token_secret":""
            }
    6. Run pixel_controller.rb to see tweets flowing to your pixels!
