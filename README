REQUIRES Adafruit_NeoPixel library for Arduino
REQUIRES serialport Ruby gem

USES 1x8 board from RGB-123
USES RaspberryPi
USES Alamode from Wyolum
USES Ruby 1.9.3

The purpose of this project is to light LEDs based on input from Twitter.

This project is not complete, and only includes the code to update the LEDs via
 a Ruby script, and the Arduino sketch to accept input from the Ruby script.

To start your blinking:
    Follow the Getting Started instructions for your Alamode
    Upload the ArduinoColorSetter.ino to your Alamode, changing Pin Number
     and NUM_LEDS as appropriate.  I'm using D7 (pin 7) on my Alamode.
    Install Ruby 1.9.3 on your RaspberryPi
    Run pixel_setter.rb to watch a Merge Sort.


BUG:  The last pixel seems to be delayed in the initial and final updates.

THANKS:
    tigoe for the incredibly understandable serial transfer method
